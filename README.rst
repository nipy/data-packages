Data packages repository
########################

This is a repository to store the nipy data packages.

The packages get served via the gh-pages branch of this repository.

To add a data package:

* add the package as a ``.tar.gz`` archive to the gh-pages branch;
* update ``index.html`` to add the archive to the web page list.

To update a package:

* add the package as a ``.tar.gz`` archive to the gh-pages branch;
* edit ``index.html`` to update the archive name on the web page list.

Please make sure that any package that gets uploaded to github, remains in
exactly that state, or gets deleted (if the package contains data that should
not have been released).

If you want to edit the packages, change the version number and therefore the
file-name.
